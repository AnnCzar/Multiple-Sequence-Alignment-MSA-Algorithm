# Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using Star Alignment Algorithm

## Introduction

This program performs multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of protein or DNA sequences using the star alignment algorithm. The star alignment algorithm is a heuristic method that aligns sequences to a central sequence (called the "star" sequence), providing an approximate but efficient alignment solution.

## Features

1. **Input Methods**:
    - Manual input of sequences.
    - Input sequences from a FASTA file.

2. **Scoring Scheme**:
    - Customizable scoring for matches, mismatches, and gap penalties.

3. **Output**:
    - Optimal alignment displayed graphically with program parameters and scores.
    - Save the alignment to a file txt
      
## Example analysis
Included in the report are two comparative analyses:

1. Evolutively Related Sequences:
  - Four sequences that share a common evolutionary ancestor.
2. Unrelated Sequences:
  - Four sequences with no known evolutionary relationship.
